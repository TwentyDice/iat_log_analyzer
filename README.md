# How to Install
All of this was only tested on Windows 10, but should work on Windows 11 and Linux / MacOs.
## Using the Installer 
Download #Todo: 
Create a folder on your system where the program files can be stored, make sure the Drive. 
Move the Executable to the new folder and run it.





## Without the installer (Linux / MacOS / I know what I'm doing):
This Software is made with Python and uses the Data Analysis Library Pandas.
You need to Install Python on your System, Version 3.9 or higher and Pandas.
Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download the Python installer. 
By Default this includes the Python package installer pip.
If you do not have pip, see here: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/

```
